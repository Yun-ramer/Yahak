<h2>CSS</h2>
  <P>
    <Strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</Strong> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a crnerstone technology of
    the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
  </P>
  <P>
    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout. colors, and fonts. This separation cna improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in
    the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, reduce complexity and repetition in the structual cotntent.
  </p>
  <p>
    Separation of formatting and content also makes it feaible to present the same markup page in different style for different rendering methods, sucs as on-screen, in print, by voice(via speech-based browser or screen reader),
     and on Braile-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.
  </p>
  <p>
    The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than on rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
  </P>
  <p>
    The CSS sepcifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.

  <p>
    In addition to HTML, other markup language support the sue of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG and XUL.
